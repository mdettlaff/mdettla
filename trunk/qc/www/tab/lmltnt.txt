Verse 2
I guess we drift alone in separate ways,
I don앖 have all that far to go, 
God Knows I learnt to play the lonely man,
I았e never felt so low in all my life,
we were born to be Just losers,
so I guess there압 a limit on how far we go,
but we only have one more day Together, so...

Tomorrow who knows just what압 in store for me

Am                            G                        D
