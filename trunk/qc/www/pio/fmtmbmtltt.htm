<b>THERE MUST BE MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS</b><br>
<br>
There must be more to life than this<br>
There must be more to life than this<br>
How do we cope in a world without love<br>
Mending all those broken hearts<br>
And tending to those crying faces<br>
There must be more to life than living<br>
There must be more than meets the eye<br>
Why should it be just a case of black or white<br>
There must be more to life than this<br>
<br>
Why is this world so full of hate<br>
People dying everywhere<br>
And we destroy what we create<br>
People fighting for their human rights<br>
But we just go on saying c'est la vie<br>
So this is life<br>
<br>
There must be more to life than killing<br>
A better way for us to survive<br>
What good is life in the end we all must die<br>
There must be more to life than this<br>
<br>
There must be more to life than this<br>
There must be more to life than this<br>
I live in hope for a world filled with love<br>
Then we can all just live in peace<br>
There must be more to life much more to life<br>
There must be more to life more to life than this
